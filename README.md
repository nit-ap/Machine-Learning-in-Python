# Machine Learning with Python 
This repository contains Machine Learning Projects in Python programming language. 
All the projects are done on Jupyter Notebooks.

## Libraries Required 
The following libraries are required to successfully implement the projects.
  - Python 3.6+
  - NumPy (for Linear Algebra)
  - Pandas (for Data Preprocesssing)
  - Scikit-learn (for ML models)
  - Matplotlib (for Data Visualization)
  - Seaborn (for statistical data visualization)

The projects are divided into various categories listed below -

## Supervised Learning 
  - [Linear Regression]()
  - [Logistic Regression]()
  - [Support Vector Machine]() 
  - [K Nearest Neighbours]()
  - [Naive Bayes]()
  - [Decision Tree Classification]()
  - [Random Forest Classification]()

## Unsupervised Learning 
  - [K Means Clustering]()K-Means clustering is used to find intrinsic groups within the unlabelled dataset and draw inferences.

## NLP(Natural Language Processing)
  - [Text Analytics]()
  - [Sentiment Analysis]()
 
## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
